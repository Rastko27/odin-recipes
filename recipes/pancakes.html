<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, 
    and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your 
    kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center 
        and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
        using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 
        to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
